# Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:
# Equals: a == b
# Not Equals: a != b
# Less than: a < b
# Less than or equal to: a <= b
# Greater than: a > b
# Greater than or equal to: a >= b


a = 40
b = 40

if a < b : 
    print("a is less than b")
elif a > b:
    print("a is greater than b")
else :
    print("Nothig")
